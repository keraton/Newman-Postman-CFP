  - Result Polling Result : BB
  - Postman : BB
  - Newman : XT
  - Who we are : BB -> XT
  - Egencia : BB
  - Use case : BB -> XT  
- Demo 
  - BB  -> Xavier please show us about the flight-service application that we have been build
  - XT  Sure ... -> Until the post Booking
        - I'm going to use Postman to show the application
        - Import swagger to postman
        - Configure the Authentication 
        -> Doing test from search, price, booking and getBooking status
  - BB  -> This look goods but, we are doing it manually
  - XT  -> Sure lets run it with run collection
        -> Show prescript
        -> Show test
        -> run collection will failed because off the getBooking is too fast
  - BB  -> This because the booking is asynchrone, and the getBooking query is to early
  - XT  -> No pb, lets add some delay
        -> Rerun the demo
  - BB  -> This is working now, but why do we need to put delay to all request, we only need delay between booking & getBooking
  - XT  -> Sure lets put some delay between them
  - BB  -> It is better but the delay is FIXED is not ideal, the booking could be very fast or very slow
  - XT  -> I know that, lets put some loop over booking 
        -> Show some loop and then 
  - BB  -> This way better, but this still manual in the sense, you developper to run it from their computer
  - XT  -> This is when I would like to introduce Newman
        -> Export collection + environment
        -> Run the collection & environment with newman
  - BB  -> Ok, instead of running from Postman we are using Newman, but it still manual
  - XT  -> The idea is to put this in our CICD
        -> Show Jenkins file
        -> Show package.json
        -> Modify some version
        -> Commit 
        -> Run the pipeline
  - BB  -> This is very cool, now we have the pipeline & regression test
        -> But you know, this is a very new app, we don't have many users, I would like to know if it is available all the time
        -> Can we can run this test all the time ?        
  - XT  -> Sure, since newman is a npm lib, we can run them from any npm platform such as AWS Lambda
        -> Show serverless + Code
  - BB  -> This is quite good but I want to be alerted
  - XT  -> Show the slack code
        -> run aws api gateway
        -> get the slack result
